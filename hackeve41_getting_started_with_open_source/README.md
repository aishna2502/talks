## Description

For this edition of the hackeve, we'll be discussing all things Open Source. The WHAT, WHY, and HOW of it.   
We'll also introduce some open source projects that some of us worked on during the summer. 
Hopefully, there will also be a PR at the end. *Hopefully*

Min Knowledge requirements: Python, Ruby, or JS. 
If you only know the basics of these, we'll still have features for you to work on. Come along even if you only know HTML/CSS, UI is an integral part of any framework.

A brief and tentative outline of the event:
- Each of the speakers will speak for about 10-15 minutes about their project and how they got started. 
- You will choose one of the projects.
- Then you(along with others who chose that project) will be guided by the speaker in kind of a one-to-one session with an aim to make your first PR to the project.

Tentative Speakers:

- Peeyush Kushwaha- Babel
- Brihi Joshi along with Shravika - Tessel
- Akarsha Sehwag- scikit-image 
- Shiven  - loklak
